# Nexus Minecraft Server

Nexus is a unique Minecraft server software that takes a different approach by utilizing a modular, enterprise architecture. It leverages Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), Domain-Driven Architecture (DDA), Dependency Injection (DI), and more to provide a highly extensible and scalable server solution.

## Features

- Modular design: Nexus is built with a modular architecture, allowing developers to easily extend and customize the server functionality by adding or removing modules.
- Event-Driven Architecture (EDA): Nexus follows an event-driven approach, where events are used to trigger actions and communicate between different components of the server.
- Domain-Driven Architecture (DDA): Nexus adopts a domain-driven approach, focusing on modeling the Minecraft game mechanics and logic using domain concepts and entities.
- Dependency Injection (DI): Nexus utilizes dependency injection to manage dependencies between different components, making it easier to maintain and test the server codebase.
- Scalability: With its enterprise architecture, Nexus is designed to handle high player loads and provide a smooth gameplay experience even in large-scale multiplayer environments.
